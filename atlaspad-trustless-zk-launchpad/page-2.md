**Yunus Emre YoldaÅŸ |Backend & Smartcontract Developer**\
_Emre, at the age of 13, ventured into the world of computers, initially introduced to it by friends as a means to play games. For the first five years, he regarded computers merely as a source of entertainment. However, later on, the creative potential within this realm steered him towards programming._

_While exploring the Android community, Emre gained insights into the inner workings of mobile phones, with a particular fascination for the_ `kernel`. _This fascination prompted a shift in his perception of computers, leading him to transition to the_ `Linux ecosystem`. _The extensive possibilities it offered to developers, coupled with its ease of configuration, opened up new horizons in programming for him._

_In the initial months, Emre rapidly acquired proficiency in programming languages like_ `C and C++`. _Challenges such as the lack of notifications for grade announcements from his university's automation system led him to delve into **web scraping** using_ `Selenium and Python`. _He later optimized this process to use pure requests instead of emulating a browser window. Emre also developed practical tools to simplify his daily life._

_A chance encounter with colleagues during a random university event led Emre to join their community, which eventually became the foundation of their group. Within this group, his primary role has been to provide clients with **web2/3 websites**, all while standing out in the **blockchain and cryptography** domain through the use of_ `TypeScript`.\
