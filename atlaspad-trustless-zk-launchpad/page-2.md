**Yunus Emre YoldaÅŸ |Backend & Smartcontract Developer**\
Name's emre. I've been introduced to the world of computing at the age of 13 in a class by my friends as a way to game. For five years computers served nothing but a medium of entertainment for me. Later on, within the same medium the creative side of it pushed me towards a bit more into programming. With the amount of customizations android community offer, it's hard not to pick up a few things here and there. I have picked up general ideas about which part of a mobile phone is responsible with what firmware-wise, the kernel fascinated me. This event has changed the way I viewed computers all together to the very definition of it and I switched to the linux ecosystem. The possibilities for developers and specifically the ease of configuration has opened a door for me in programming. During my first couple months I have quickly learnt C, C++. Some obstacles like lack of notifications for grade announcements from my university's automation system has led me get into webscraping with selenium and python, later on optimizing it to pure requests rather than puppeteering a browser window. Until recently I have built neat little tools to aid me in my everyday life. In our University I met with my colleagues during a random event. There I have been selected to join their community which would later on become the very foundation of our group. For a while my part in our group has been providing our clients with web2/3 websites (with the dedicated effort of my team of course).\
