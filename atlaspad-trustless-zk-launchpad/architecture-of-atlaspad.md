**`4. Data Storage and Verification Layer`**

The Data Layer employs Merkle Mountain Ranges for data integrity and offers off-chain storage with homomorphic encryption for enhanced security. It also utilizes IPFS or Celestia for data availability, ensuring that the launchpadâ€™s data remains accessible and immutable.

_Components:_

**- **<mark style="color:purple;">**Merkle Tree(MMR-Merkle Mountain Ranges):**</mark>  Data structure that stores users' token allocations and authentication information.\
The Merkle Proof consists of a construction that shows how to locate an input (OutX) in the total set of outputs MMR.\
\
Merkle Mountain Ranges is a structure used as an alternative to traditional Merkle trees. Merkle Mountain Ranges is a fully additive structure and items are added from left to right. MMR can be seen as a list of fully balanced binary trees of elements or as a single binary tree cut from the top right. MMR is used in the Grin project to store kernel, outputs and range proofs.\
&#x20;

_Structure and Functions:_

* <mark style="color:purple;">**Height:**</mark> The height of each node in the MMR is obtained from the row to which it is added.
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**Hashing and Branching:**</mark> The parent nodes in MMR contain the hash of its two children. Grin uses the **`Blake2b`** hash function and always adds the position of the node before hashing. For example, if a leaf contains **`l`**, index **`n`** and data **`D`**:

    {% code title="merkle.js" %}
    ```javascript
    Node(l) = Blake2b(n | D)
    ```
    {% endcode %}
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Bagging the Peaks:**</mark> _A process is used to find the peaks in the MMR. The first left-hand peak is_ always the highest and always has a position "filled with ones". The position of the first peak can be expressed as `2^n - 1,`which is smaller than the total size of the MMR. To find the other peaks, we move to their right siblings. This process is repeated until the positions of the peaks are determined.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Pruning:**</mark> In Grin, some of the data in MMRs can be removed over time. In doing so, some leaves become redundant and their hashes can be removed. When enough leaves are removed, the existence of their parent nodes may also become redundant. Therefore, a significant portion of the MMR can be pruned by removing its leaves.\
  \
  Merkle Proof includes the following:\
  \- The hash of the leaf representing `OutX.`\
  \- The hash of the overall root in the tree.\
  \- A sequence of hashes representing all MMR vertices (this shows that together they form the overall root).- A list of sibling hashes to enable the construction of the branch from OutX to the top.\
  \- A list of sibling positions (left/right) to ensure the correct reconstruction of the branch. Merkle Proof is used to prove that a node is below its vertex and show that the vertexes form the overall root.

\
_Coinbase Output:_\
\
The wallet holds a Merkle Proof (and the corresponding block hash) for each unused coinbase output. In order to spend the coinbase output, the block hash and Merkle Proof must be provided on entry. This is used to verify coinbase maturity and does not require full block data.\
\
_Wallet Verification:_\
\
**- **<mark style="color:purple;">**Initial Setup:**</mark> Each user's wallet is associated with a unique leaf in the MMR. When a user registers or makes their first transaction, their wallet's public information and a unique identifier (nullifier) are hashed and added to the MMR.

\
**- **<mark style="color:purple;">**zk-Proof Generation:**</mark> When a user initiates a session, they generate a zk-Proof that attests to the existence of their wallet's hash in the MMR without revealing the wallet's actual details. This proof can confirm the wallet's validity and the user's ownership securely and privately.

\
_Transaction Processing:_\
\
**- **<mark style="color:purple;">**Transaction Verification:**</mark> When a transaction is initiated, the MMR is used to verify that the participating wallets are valid and have not been double-spent. This verification is done by generating a zk-Proof that attests to the presence of the wallets' identifiers in the MMR and the absence of these identifiers in the list of spent nullifiers.\
\
**- **<mark style="color:purple;">**Update Mechanism:**</mark> Once a transaction is verified and completed, the MMR is updated. This update includes appending new transactions and pruning spent outputs, which is critical for maintaining the MMR's efficiency and compactness.\
\
**- **<mark style="color:purple;">**ZK Proofs:**</mark> Cryptographic proofs used to protect users' privacy while verifying the validity of their transactions.

_Functionality:_

\- The Merkle Tree is required for users to prove their identity and token allocation in each session.\
\- ZK Proofs allow users to prove the authenticity of their transactions without revealing any personal information on the network.

_Architecture Highlights:_

\- <mark style="color:purple;">**Off-Chain Storage with Homomorphic Encryption:**</mark> Provides a secure way to compute on encrypted data.\
\- <mark style="color:purple;">**IPFS or Celestia Data Availability:**</mark> Offers decentralized storage solutions for persistent data availability.

**`5. Oracle Layer`**

Our primary objective is to incorporate the use of oracles into our system. To achieve this, we are planning to write a distinct `Oracle for each Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)` network that is connected to our zkApp. This is a deliberate strategy we are adopting in order to ensure robust and efficient communication and interaction between the various networks. We believe this is the most optimized and least compromising strategy available.\
\
â€¢ In Atlas Oracle we will create ABIs to integrate with external data providers (contracts and user). These ABI functions will communicate with Merkle Tree to work with other MINA wallets to write an Oracle in each network.

</div>





**`6. Wallet Layer:`**

Especially when we encourage the use of MINA's wallet and associate the EVM-based wallet with the MINA wallet, EVM users will be indirectly encouraged into the MINA ecosystem as our platform will create an interlinked MINA wallet for them seamlessly (if they lack it) behind the scenes and more zkApp projects will come for our Launchpad. The Wallet Layer is where financial management takes place. It encompasses core functionalities such as transaction management and user wallet services. Cross-chain compatibility and blockchain network communication signify the layer's ability to interact smoothly across different blockchain infrastructures.&#x20;

_Architecture Highlights:_

**1. **<mark style="color:purple;">**Core Function/Implementation:**</mark> Manages all wallet operations with high security and efficiency.\
\
**2. **<mark style="color:purple;">**User Wallets/Transaction Management:**</mark> Provides users with full control over their transactions and funds.\
\
**3. **<mark style="color:purple;">**Cross-Chain Compatibility:**</mark> Ensures the wallet can operate over multiple blockchains, increasing its utility.

_Why It's the Right Choice:_

\- The focus on core wallet functionalities ensures a secure and reliable financial environment.\
\

\
_Technology:_\
\
\- ZK launchpad investigates interactions of the complex structure between ever-growing blockchain ecosystem\
\- Provides asset management across multiple blockchains such as mina and EVM blockchains- Improves the privacy and security of user with the use of Merkle Trees and zero-knowledge proofs.\
&#x20;

â€¢ In the zkApp section of our Launchpad, when a user provides their MetaMask wallet, zkApp associates an Atlaspad Mina wallet with the user (client side) and returns it. To examine this process in detail, you can refer to the diagrams available in the links.\
\
â€¢ Launchpad utilizes **MMR Merkle Tree** algorithms in zkApp's offchain database and performs **nullifier** operations for access tokens to conduct zk-proof verifications.\
\
â€¢ There is **no KPI** due to zkApps
